## 1. Overview

OLSSA (Obfuscated Luau Script Security Auditor) is a utility designed to enhance the security of Lua scripts used in Roblox games.  
It aims to prevent potential security vulnerabilities and unauthorized activities by detecting suspicious behavior within obfuscated scripts.

## 2. Installation

To use OLSSA in your Roblox game, follow these steps:

1. Copy the code provided in the script you received.
2. Paste the code at the top of your Lua script, ensuring it is executed before any other code.
3. Customize the configuration settings to meet your security requirements.

## 3. Configuration

OLSSA's behavior can be customized through the configuration settings located at the beginning of the script.  

## 4. Spoofing

OLSSA provides various spoofing mechanisms to alter and test the behavior of certain services and functions.  
Spoofing can be enabled or disabled for specific services, such as MarketplaceService, RunService, and HttpService.  

## 5. Sandboxing

Sandboxing in OLSSA isolates the results of the require function and certain functions within sandboxed environments. It aims to prevent malicious code from accessing or modifying global variables.

## 6. Protecting Scripts

To prevent your scripts from being impacted by OLSSA, consider the following:

- Write clean and legitimate code following Roblox's scripting guidelines.
- Avoid including code that could be misinterpreted as malicious or unauthorized behavior.
- Regularly review and test your code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- Avoid depending on online HTTP requests, or enabling HTTP requests. (Consider this utility as something like Wireshark)
